Hi I'm so sorry I was so horrible at time management this week and got cocky once I started to understand the pseudocode I wrote. Although I studied over the summer, my knowledge of C++ is still very limited and I need to sit down and read the book more thoroughly. Corey tried to help but I was a bit of a lost cause. Once I fugure out how to fix my code in a few days I was thoroughly understand it I promise.  <3 Also, I spent so much time trying to figure out why my Special Configuration Mode didnt work that I just didn't so much on the Random Configuration.
